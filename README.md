 ## React
 For the front end, some react-bootstrap components were installed and imported to files, to allow usage on the front page. This include the Carousels, on both the review and products page (iPhones only). The Carousels needed to be contained, and then adding the components of the individual parts (labled <Carousel.PartName(/)>) of what was being displayed in the Carousel. This included <Carousel.Item> and <Carousel.Caption/>.
 Another was Nav, Navbar, NavDropdown . This included <Navbar.Toggle aria-controls="responsive-navbar-nav" />
 and <Navbar.Collapse id="responsive-navbar-nav">, which allows for the "Hamburger Menu" to be utilized on the page, for any and all screens. The <Nav.Link> contains the href being sought (defined in main.jsx) and the text Name that appears on this </Nav.Link>;
 Form, Button, Alert on reviewForm.jsx. This allowed a Form to be created, allowing components to be rendered on the page. Form.Label allows for written text, and Form.Control allows one to include functions to be called within to allow value to be taken. The Button also allows for functions to get called by its verson of an "event listener"; 
 Accordion allows a title "button" to open a dropdown by clicking on the text within the Accordian.
